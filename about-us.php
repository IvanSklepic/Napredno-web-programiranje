	<p>iFixit is a wiki-based site that teaches people how to fix almost anything. Anyone can create a repair manual for a device,</p>
	<p>and anyone can also edit the existing set of manuals to improve them. Our site empowers individuals to share their technical</p>
	<p>knowledge with the rest of the world. It bugged us that most consumer devices lacked repair instructions. We think it should </p>
	<p>be easy for people to learn how to fix things. So we wrote some instructions the first chance we got. And we posted them online,</p>
	<p>for free. For the first time, it was easy for someone with no technical background or experience to take apart a Mac.</p>
	<p>Our step-by-step instructions were enabling people to repair Macs they wouldnt have been able to repair on their own.</p>
	<p>We thought the instructions would be useful to our customers -- and they were. But it turned out that they were useful</p>
	<p>to a lot of other people as well! Weve heard repair success stories from forensic detectives, field translators, and</p>
	<p>even kids. From New York to Alaska, Tibet to the Faroe Islands, people have used our guides to fix their stuff. They saved</p>
	<p>money, they kept their Macs out of landfills, and they did it completely by themselves. And the amazing thing? They enjoyed </p>
	<p>doing it. It is fun to take stuff apart. It is interesting to see what is inside that magic iPod you carry around every day.</p>
	<p>It is gratifying to fix it with your own hands. Dont believe us? Try it! Fix your Mac yourself. Show a friend how to fix something.</a></p>';
