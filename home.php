	<p>Want to know how to replace that cracked screen on your phone? Or maybe you want to</p> 
	<p>know if the newest gadget is worth the sticker shock? Then you’ve come to the right place!</p>
	<p>iFixit is a global repair community of people helping each other fix their stuff. We are millions of tinkerers,</p>
	<p>technicians, and volunteers working together to help people repair their devices every day. Why? Because most companies</p>
	<p>dont provide repair parts and documentation. We believe that everyone has the right to maintain and repair their products—however</p>
	<p>they see fit. Together we’re fixing the world, one broken gadget at a time!</p>
